# How to setup:
Herb cleaner:
Works at GE, cleans herbs automaticlly. All you need is to set up the right grimy herb ID.


Varrock Smither:
Need a hammer in Inventory and bars in bank. Stay close to the banker thats near the anvil.
If bank is out of bars, plugin will stop.

My plugins work with Owain's chinbreakhandler and illumineawake Botutils.
